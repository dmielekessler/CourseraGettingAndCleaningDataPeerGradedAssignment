## README for David Kessler's Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project

This is the README file for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project. The first section is my general comments, the second section is the README file (in its entirety) from the provided data set.

The project requires creatiob of one R script called run_analysis.R takes the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The run_analysis.R script does these things.

Steps 1 and 2 seem to me to be self explanatory form the R script, the comments in the R script and the code book.

For step 3, I used the descriptive activity names chosen by the data set authors. WALKING, LAYING, etc. These appear to me to be descriptive.

For step 4, I updated the data sets names descriptive names by removing the extraneous characters and changing acc to acceleration. All the other pieces (mean, std, etc) appeared to me to be descriptive.

The output file "measurementaveragesbysubjectandactivity.csv" from the run_analysis.R script is my submission for step 5.

run_analysis.R is built as a stand alone R program. It assumes the data has not been previously downloaded or unzipped.
If a file named "UCI HAR Dataset" exists in the working directory at the beginning of the script, the script deletes it.
Similarly for the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder and "measurementaveragesbysubjectandactivity.csv" output csv.

run_analysis.R uses the tidyverse package. I recomemnd installing this prior to running the script.
The script will install the package for you, and may request if you want ot restart R to continue if you don't have it installed.
The script will finish after the restart, if you choose to restart.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
